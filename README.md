# Starcounter

Starcounter is an enterprise grade memory centric [database management system (DBMS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dbms) (a.k.a. RAM database) with a built in [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dbms) style server. It supports [graph](https://github.com/Starcounter/Starcounter/wiki/Graphs), object, document and relational semantics in a single unified model and is fully [ACID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acid) compliant with advanced concurrency control and transaction isolation modes.

It makes creating line of business systems a breeze.
