# Here you can specify your external repositories that will be pulled by
# test framework, all solutions will be built there and all tests runned.
# One can specify the environment variable to enable/disable pulling
# for the corresponding test (so we don't need to pull everything, it takes time).

# Format: GitRepoUrl %BranchName% [%EnvVarName%]
