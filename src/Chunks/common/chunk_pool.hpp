// The chunk_pool relies on Boost Threads and Boost Bind libraries and Boost
// call_traits utility.

// The push_front() method is called in order to insert a new item into the buffer.
// If there is a space in the buffer available, the execution continues and the
// method inserts the item at the end of the chunk_pool. Then it increments
// the number of unread items.

// The pop_back() method is called in order to read the next item from the buffer.
// If there is at least one unread item, the method decrements the number of unread
// items and reads the next item from the chunk_pool.

// The pop_back() method does not remove the item but the item is left in the
// chunk_pool which then replaces it with a new one (inserted by a producer)
// when the chunk_pool is full. This technique is more effective than removing
// the item explicitly by calling the pop_back() method of the chunk_pool.
// This claim is based on the assumption that an assignment (replacement) of a
// new item into an old one is more effective than a destruction (removal) of an
// old item and a consequent inplace construction (insertion) of a new item.
