// The IPC monitor watches over up to 64 database processes, and up to 256
// client processes. These limits are compile time configurable.
//
// A database- or client process that wants to be monitored must first register
// its pid to the IPC monitor and receive an owner_id. After this the process is
// being monitored.
//
// When a client process allocates a resource, such as a chunk or a channel in
// shared memory, the client uses its owner_id which will be linked to the
// resource.
//
// A process that have registered, that intend to exit may unregistere itself
// after it have released all resources.
//
// If a process exit or crashes, the IPC monitor eventually do cleanup and
// restores all resources, such as memory chunks, channels and
// client_interfaces.
//
// There must be exactly one IPC monitor running in the same user space for each
// server. If an IPC monitor terminates unexcpectedly, then all database- and
// client process that it monitors have to terminate as well.
// If an IPC monitor exit then database- and client processes can not detect this.

// A server starts a monitor.exe before it starts any databases.
//
// The monitor process has int wmain(int argc, wchar_t* argv[], wchar_t* envp[])
// and not int main(int argc, char* argv[]).
//
// The server waits for about 5 seconds. Within this time period the server must
// have received an acknowledge from the monitor on standard input/output.
//
// If the monitor starts successfully, it acks with L"monitoring" (wchar_t) on
// standard output. After that the server can start databases as usual.
//
// If the monitor fails to start, the process will exit and the server receives
// EOF (end-of-file.) If the monitor cannot be started, the system cannot be
// started.

// Arguments to the monitor (wchar_t):
// First argument: server_name (L"PERSONAL" or L"SYSTEM", etc.)
//
// Second argument: Path to the dir where the monitor's
// "active_databases" file can be stored.
