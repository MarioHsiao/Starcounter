2.1 CSAppsTemplate
A project template for the C# language that allows the creation of an App-based executable.
The output of this project is a .zip file that contains the templates and can be installed into
Visual Studio.

The template defines/references the flavored project type with the unique ID {2343A348-E64C-4CD2-89E0-E5165AC7ABB1}.
When such a template is instantiated, it will trigger our Visual Studio extension package to be loaded,
and that way we can customize the development experience to support our "apps" model.
