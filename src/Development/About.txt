1. About
--------
The Development hive contains the code, the setup projects and the templates needed to integrate Starcounter with Visual Studio.

2. Projects
-----------

2.1 Starcounter.VS.CSAppsProjectTemplate
A project template for the C# language that allows the creation of an App-based executable.
The output of this project is a .zip file that contains the templates and can be installed into
Visual Studio.

The template defines/references the flavored project type with the unique ID {2343A348-E64C-4CD2-89E0-E5165AC7ABB1}.
When such a template is instantiated, it will trigger our Visual Studio extension package to be loaded,
and that way we can customize the development experience to support our "apps" model.

2.2 Starcounter.VisualStudio
A project that creates the .dll that loads into Visual Studio when a Starcounter project is created,
based on any of our templates.

The output of this project is a library called Starcounter.VisualStudio.dll that runs from our standard
installation directory (and builds to \bin\Debug | \bin\Release like other projects).
