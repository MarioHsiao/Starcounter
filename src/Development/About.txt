1. About
--------
The Development hive contains the code, the setup projects and the templates needed to integrate Starcounter with Visual Studio.

2. Projects
-----------

-- 2.1 Starcounter.VS.CSAppsProjectTemplate --
A project template for the C# language that allows the creation of an App-based executable.
The output of this project is a .zip file that contains the templates and can be installed into
Visual Studio.

The template defines/references the flavored project type with the unique ID {C86118D7-451E-4933-BFEE-A1EFDB162FD7}.
When such a template is instantiated, it will trigger our Visual Studio extension package to be loaded,
and that way we can customize the development experience to support our "apps" model.

-- 2.2 Starcounter.VisualStudio --
A project that creates the .dll that loads into Visual Studio when a Starcounter project is created,
based on any of our templates.

The output of this project is a library called Starcounter.VisualStudio.dll that runs from our standard
installation directory (and builds to \bin\Debug | \bin\Release like other projects).

-- 2.3 Starcounter.VS.VSIX (depends on 2.1 and 2.2) --
A project that creates a .vsix file, used to install the Starcounter extension (2.2) and the project templates
that we want to support (currently only 2.1).

To read about VSIX basics, consult this link: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/quanto/archive/2009/05/26/what-is-a-vsix.aspx

The output of this project is a .vsix file that can be double-clicked in the Windows shell to install Starcounter
into Visual Studio, or used from a custom installer in conjunction with the VSIXInstaller.exe. To see a sample of
the later, consult the \Sample\SampleProgrammaticInstall.cs.
