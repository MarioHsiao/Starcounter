Backlog for server integration

# ServerStatisticsCollector
# Make sure all configuration properties are forced to be present
  in the serialized form (XML), even if just as XML:NIL. This way,
  we lower confusion as to what values are really used and we need
  no handling for ApplyDefaults or anything. As soon as a configuration
  is created (and serialized), we expect it to have all values represented.
# Migrate ServerInstance.GetImageFileMaxSize and ServerInstance.GetImageFileMaxSize
  and utilize them in Database.ToPublicModel(). Have it in DatabaseStorageService.cs.
# Add logging and tracing calls.

NEXTs
# Redirect standard streams in Starcounter.Bootstrap when the console is
redirected.
# Implement DeleteDatabase command in server.
# Implement AppsService.Stop (using event in the listener thread in AppsProcess).
# Comment, refactor and clean the command dispatcher.
# Comment, refactor and clean the command processor base class.
# Refactor CommandProcessor, making it a generic, like CommandProcessor<T> :
ServerCommand and get rid of custom attribute (make IsPublic virtual).
