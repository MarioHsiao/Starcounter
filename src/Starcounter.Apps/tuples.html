<h1>The internal tuple format</h1>
<p>
SQL projections and App view models are all stored as Starcounter session tuples. A session tuple is a transient
data structure (it is not stored on disk). Tuple values can have the same data types as JSON plus the values available
in the database (types allowed by Entity). 
</p>
<p>
For the user (the software developer), tuples are often exposed as JSON or SQL results. Internally however, they are stored
inside big chunks of memory called SessionBlobs. Each session has one or more SessionBlobs (new blobs are added when needed and sometimes
they are merged together). The tuples are stored in one of three binary formats. Two formats avoid non printable bytes (ASCII/UTF-8).
This allows the contents of these tuples to be copied directly to the network and the end consumer (for example a browser).
