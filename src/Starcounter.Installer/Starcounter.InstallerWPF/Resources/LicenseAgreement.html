test results (<strong>"Competing Software"</strong>) must be publicly available 
to Starcounter.</p>

Jocke suggest: " and in addition any products own, controller or managed by the 
Customer or its affiliates".
Peter comment: Such a vague definition of Compteting Products is problematic 
since we require proof that we can benchmark test all of them.
-->

information necessary for replication of the tests, including complete and
accurate details of the benchmark testing methodology, the test scripts/cases,
tuning parameters applied, hardware and software platforms tested, the name and

see Paragraph 2.5.</p>

<p>12.2 For Customer's use of the Licensed Software under Commercial License, 
Starcounter shall defend, indemnify and hold Customer harmless from any action 
brought against Customer to the extent that the action is based on a claim 
that the Licensed Software has infringed any patent, copyright or any other 
intellectual proprietary rights in the European Union, according to the 
following:</p>

<p>12.2.1 Starcounter shall indemnify Customer against any costs, settlement 
and damages finally awarded provided that Customer: 
(a) promptly notifies Starcounter in writing of any claim; 
(b) gives Starcounter sole control of the defense and settlement thereof; and 
(c) provides, at its own expense, all reasonable assistance in connection 
therewith.</p>

<p>12.2.2 In the event of any action or threat thereof, Starcounter shall at 
its option and expense: 
(a) procure for Customer the right to continue to use the Licensed Software; 
or (b) replace or modify the Licensed Software with functionally compatible, 
non-infringing software. If such settlement or such modification is not 
reasonably practical in the opinion of Starcounter, or if a temporary or final 
injunction or other judgment is obtained against Starcounter with respect to 
the Licensed Software or any part thereof, Starcounter may terminate this 
Agreement and the license granted hereunder upon fifteen (15) days written 
notice to Customer and shall refund to Customer the unamortized portion of the 
amounts paid to Starcounter by Customer for the development and/or acquisition 
thereof based upon five (5) year straight-line depreciation, such depreciation 
to commence on the date on which the Licensed Software was first accepted 
hereunder. Upon such repayment, Starcounter shall be discharged of all further 
liability hereunder except for the obligations set forth in Paragraph 12.2.1.</p>

<p>12.2.3 To the extent its agreement with a vendor of Third Party Software 
permits, Starcounter will pass through to Customer any proprietary rights 
indemnity relating to such Third Party Software; provided however that 
Starcounter gives no additional or supplemental indemnity with respect 
thereto.</p>

<p>12.2.4 Starcounter shall have no liability regarding any claim out of: 
(a) use of other than the two (2) latest unaltered releases of the Licensed 
Software unless the infringing portion is also in the then current unaltered 
release; (b) any modification or derivation of the Licensed Software not 
specifically authorized in writing by Starcounter; or (c) any use of results 
or output generated by the Licensed Software.</p>

<p>12.2.5 The foregoing states the entire liability of Starcounter and the 
exclusive remedies of Customer with respect to the infringement of any 
proprietary rights by the Licensed Software or any parts thereof, and Customer 
hereby expressly waives any other such liabilities.</p>

<h2>13 Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p class="highlight">13.1 Neither party shall be liable for consequential, 
exemplary or incidental damages of the other party, or of direct damages 
greater than the limitations established herein even if it has been advised 
of the possibility of such damages.</p>

liable to Customer for cumulative direct damages greater than the total amount
having then been paid by Customer to Starcounter under this Agreement.</p>

<p>13.3 Customer releases Starcounter from all
obligations, liability, claims, or demands relating to the Licensed Software
and Documentation in excess of the limitations provided for in this Section 13 
("Limitation of Liability").</p>

claim or cause of action against third party licensors to Starcounter of any Third
Party Software that is delivered together with the Licensed Software, except to
the extent such rights have been duly assigned to Customer.</p>

<p>13.5 The parties acknowledge that the limitation set forth in this Section 13
("Limitation of Liability") is integral to the amount of fees levied in
connection with the license of the Licensed Software and that, were Starcounter
to assume any further liability other than as set forth herein, such fees would
of necessity be set substantially higher.</p>

<h2>14 Force Majeure</h2>

<p>14.1 Neither party shall be liable for
default or delay caused by any occurrence beyond its reasonable control or
beyond the reasonable control of any subcontractor, including but not limited
to fires, strikes, accidents and acts of God. In the event Starcounter should
be delayed in the completion of any portion of the work by reason of any such
occurrence, the time within which the portion of work is to be completed shall
be extended by the period of such delay, but no such extension shall be made unless
a notice thereof is presented by Starcounter to Customer in writing within
fifteen (15) days after the occurrence of such delay and no payment shall be
made by Customer to Starcounter for any expenses incurred by Starcounter by
reason of any such default or delay.</p>

<h2>15 Assignment</h2>

<p>15.1 Starcounter may assign, without consent of Customer, this Agreement
and all of its rights and obligations hereunder to an assignee, which shall 
be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<h2>16 Taxes</h2>

<p>16.1 All taxes, withholdings, duties, fees
and other governmental charges of any kind (including sales and use taxes, but
excluding taxes based on the gross revenues or net income of Starcounter) which
are imposed by or under the authority of Customer's country on the amounts
charged by Starcounter to Customer under this Agreement shall be borne by
Customer and shall not be considered a part of, a deduction from or an offset
against the fees charged to Customer hereunder. If Customer is required to pay
any withholding tax, charge or levy in respect of any payments due to
Starcounter hereunder, Customer agrees to gross up payments actually made such
that Starcounter shall receive sums due hereunder in full and free of any
deduction for any such withholding tax, charge or levy.</p>

<h2>17 Governing Law</h2>

<p>17.1 This Agreement shall be construed in
accordance with and be governed by the laws of Sweden with exclusion of its
conflict of laws principles.</p>

<p>17.2 In the event any one or more of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this
Agreement shall remain in effect and the Agreement shall be read as though the
offending provision had not been written or as the provision shall be
determined by such court to be read.</p>
