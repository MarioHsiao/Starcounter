/*
 * SubLink
 *
 * A SubLink represents a subselect appearing in an expression, and in some
 * cases also the combining operator(s) just above it.	The subLinkType
 * indicates the form of the expression represented:
 *	EXISTS_SUBLINK		EXISTS(SELECT ...)
 *	ALL_SUBLINK			(lefthand) op ALL (SELECT ...)
 *	ANY_SUBLINK			(lefthand) op ANY (SELECT ...)
 *	ROWCOMPARE_SUBLINK	(lefthand) op (SELECT ...)
 *	EXPR_SUBLINK		(SELECT with single targetlist item ...)
 *	ARRAY_SUBLINK		ARRAY(SELECT with single targetlist item ...)
 *	CTE_SUBLINK			WITH query (never actually part of an expression)
 * For ALL, ANY, and ROWCOMPARE, the lefthand is a list of expressions of the
 * same length as the subselect's targetlist.  ROWCOMPARE will *always* have
 * a list with more than one entry; if the subselect has just one target
 * then the parser will create an EXPR_SUBLINK instead (and any operator
 * above the subselect will be represented separately).  Note that both
 * ROWCOMPARE and EXPR require the subselect to deliver only one row.
 * ALL, ANY, and ROWCOMPARE require the combining operators to deliver boolean
 * results.  ALL and ANY combine the per-row results using AND and OR
 * semantics respectively.
 * ARRAY requires just one target column, and creates an array of the target
 * column's type using any number of rows resulting from the subselect.
 *
 * SubLink is classed as an Expr node, but it is not actually executable;
 * it must be replaced in the expression tree by a SubPlan node during
 * planning.
 *
 * NOTE: in the raw output of gram.y, testexpr contains just the raw form
 * of the lefthand expression (if any), and operName is the String name of
 * the combining operator.	Also, subselect is a raw parsetree.  During parse
 * analysis, the parser transforms testexpr into a complete boolean expression
 * that compares the lefthand value(s) to PARAM_SUBLINK nodes representing the
 * output columns of the subselect.  And subselect is transformed to a Query.
 * This is the representation seen in saved rules and in the rewriter.
 *
 * In EXISTS, EXPR, and ARRAY SubLinks, testexpr and operName are unused and
 * are always null.
 *
 * The CTE_SUBLINK case never occurs in actual SubLink nodes, but it is used
 * in SubPlans generated for WITH subqueries.

 * CaseExpr - a CASE expression
 *
 * We support two distinct forms of CASE expression:
 *		CASE WHEN boolexpr THEN expr [ WHEN boolexpr THEN expr ... ]
 *		CASE testexpr WHEN compexpr THEN expr [ WHEN compexpr THEN expr ... ]
 * These are distinguishable by the "arg" field being NULL in the first case
 * and the testexpr in the second case.
 *
 * In the raw grammar output for the second form, the condition expressions
 * of the WHEN clauses are just the comparison values.	Parse analysis
 * converts these to valid boolean expressions of the form
 *		CaseTestExpr '=' compexpr
 * where the CaseTestExpr node is a placeholder that emits the correct
 * value at runtime.  This structure is used so that the testexpr need be
 * evaluated only once.  Note that after parse analysis, the condition
 * expressions always yield boolean.
 *

 * yet by checking whether casetype is InvalidOid or not.

 * to be shorter than the rowtype.	That is, the N'th list element must
 * match up with the N'th physical field.  When the N'th physical field
 * is a dropped column (attisdropped) then the N'th list element can just
 * be a NULL constant.	(This case can only occur for named composite types,
 * not RECORD types, since those are built from the RowExpr itself rather
 * than vice versa.)  It is important not to assume that length(args) is
 * the same as the number of columns logically present in the rowtype.
 *
 * colnames is NIL in a RowExpr built from an ordinary ROW() expression.

 *					node types for join trees
 *
 * The leaves of a join tree structure are RangeTblRef nodes.  Above
 * these, JoinExpr nodes can appear to denote a specific kind of join
 * or qualified join.  Also, FromExpr nodes can appear to denote an
 * ordinary cross-product join ("FROM foo, bar, baz WHERE ...").
 * FromExpr is like a JoinExpr of jointype JOIN_INNER, except that it
 * may have any number of child nodes, not just two.
 *
 * NOTE: the top level of a Query's jointree is always a FromExpr.
 * Even if the jointree contains no rels, there will be a FromExpr.
 *
 * NOTE: the qualification expressions present in JoinExpr nodes are
 * *in addition to* the query's main WHERE clause, which appears as the
 * qual of the top-level FromExpr.	The reason for associating quals with
 * specific nodes in the jointree is that the position of a qual is critical
 * when outer joins are present.  (If we enforce a qual too soon or too late,
 * that may cause the outer join to produce the wrong set of NULL-extended
 * rows.)  If all joins are inner joins then all the qual positions are
 * semantically interchangeable.
 *
 * NOTE: in the raw output of gram.y, a join tree contains RangeVar,
 * RangeSubselect, and RangeFunction nodes, which are all replaced by
 * RangeTblRef nodes during the parse analysis phase.  Also, the top-level
 * FromExpr is added during parse analysis; the grammar regards FROM and
 * WHERE as separate.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------

/*----------
 * JoinExpr - for SQL JOIN expressions
 *
 * isNatural, usingClause, and quals are interdependent.  The user can write
 * only one of NATURAL, USING(), or ON() (this is enforced by the grammar).
 * If he writes NATURAL then parse analysis generates the equivalent USING()
 * list, and from that fills in "quals" with the right equality comparisons.
 * If he writes USING() then "quals" is filled with equality comparisons.
 * If he writes ON() then only "quals" is set.	Note that NATURAL/USING
 * are not equivalent to ON() since they also affect the output column list.
 *
 * alias is an Alias node representing the AS alias-clause attached to the
 * join expression, or NULL if no clause.  NB: presence or absence of the
 * alias has a critical impact on semantics, because a join with an alias
 * restricts visibility of the tables/columns inside it.
 *
 * During parse analysis, an RTE is created for the Join, and its index
 * is filled into rtindex.	This RTE is present mainly so that Vars can
 * be created that refer to the outputs of the join.  The planner sometimes
 * generates JoinExprs internally; these can have rtindex = 0 if there are
 * no join alias variables referencing such joins.
