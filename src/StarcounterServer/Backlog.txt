# ServerStatisticsCollector
# Make sure all configuration properties are forced to be present
  in the serialized form (XML), even if just as XML:NIL. This way,
  we lower confusion as to what values are really used and we need
  no handling for ApplyDefaults or anything. As soon as a configuration
  is created (and serialized), we expect it to have all values represented.
# Migrate ServerInstance.GetImageFileMaxSize and ServerInstance.GetImageFileMaxSize
  and utilize them in Database.ToPublicModel().
# Add logging and tracing calls.
