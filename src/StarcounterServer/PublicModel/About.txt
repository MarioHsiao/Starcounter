About the StarcounterServer.PublicModel classes
-----------------------------------------------

The "public model" is the logical exposed view of the server. The
server keeps an up-to-date snapshot of this model internally, one
that can instantly be exposed to management clients.

The classes in this namespace are not, at least initially, exposed
"as is", i.e. the types themselves are not accessible to code outside
the server. Instead, instances of these types represent state that
can be fetched by means of a management API and that state is kept by
the server in thread-safe structures, maintained "outside" the inner
server representation. 

The format of the exposed model, once it goes over the wire, is not yet
set (will most likely be in the form of strings, paired as key-values,
in the first release).
